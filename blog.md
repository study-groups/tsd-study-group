## Putting the Ahhh in Auto Regression, or, how I came to understand A.R.I.M.A.

First, I read Granger and Newbold's 
[Regressions in Econometics](https://wolfweb.unr.edu/homepage/zal/STAT758/Granger_Newbold_1974.pdf).

Then read John D Cook's blog post 
[Time series analysis vs DSP terminology](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2017/10/20/time-series-analysis-vs-dsp-terminology-ma-arma-fir-iir/)
